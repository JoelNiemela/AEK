{"data": "I sense someone walk up behind me and twist around to look at him. Petren, our senior assassin, nods once before taking a seat across from me. Petren had been the one who volunteered and put together the team for our mission. We were all members of the Assassins Guild, which I think is a pretty self-explanatory name.\nAnyways, our mission was given to us just a few days ago and we were all chosen by Petren, who was basically a living legend among assassins. He was a battle-axe wielder as well as an archer, great for both up close and long-distance combat. Jia was chosen because she was the most powerful firebender we had, and she was a great strategist. Eleni was also one of the best in the guild, she took and filled assassination contracts faster than most of the seniors. I think it was probably because she was just a little bit insane, but she gets stuff done so who am I to question it. As for me, well. It\u2019s a bit embarrassing really, but this is my first mission. I\u2019d done small contracts, sure. A beggar here, a lone hunter there, but never anything big and important. \nThis is kind of like my big test. If I fail this, I\u2019m out of the guild. And nobody can just leave the guild so they\u2019d have to eliminate me. That\u2019s why I was put on the team with the best of the best. Even if I didn\u2019t perform super well, the rest of the team could easily pick up my slack. Not to say I planned on failing, but you never really know what might happen. There are always so many possibilities.\n\u201cDo you feel as though you\u2019ve prepared yourself for what is to come?\u201d Petren asks, interrupting my thoughts. It\u2019s a great question. Our mission was to assassinate the Elven King in the city of Selasera, the biggest city in the world. Have I prepared myself for this? \n\n\n[CHOICES]\n\u201cOh yeah, absolutely. No trouble at all.\u201d -> set Petren_relation - 2; goto Page 4_1 # reduce relation\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m actually kinda nervous.\u201d -> set Petren_relation + 2; goto Page 4_2 # increase relation\n\n", "title": " Talk with Petren"}
